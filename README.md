### TileGeoJSON

A highly efficient JavaScript library for cutting GeoJSON data
into [vector tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/) (or rather their JSON equivalent), primarily for rendering purposes.

Created to power GeoJSON rendering in [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).

#### Usage

```js
var tileIndex = tileGeoJSON(geoJSON, maxZoom);
```
